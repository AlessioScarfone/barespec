Use when setting up hook customization, configuring hooks, adding new hooks, reviewing or editing hook settings, or when asked to "setup barespec", "configure hooks", "edit the config yml", or "add a pre-hook".

Scaffold or update the barespec configuration file at `./barespec/barespec.config.yml`.

This file is read by `init-context`, `spec-create`, `spec-plan`, and `spec-implement` to inject custom pre/post instructions into their workflows.

---

## Entry point

1. Check whether `./barespec/barespec.config.yml` already exists.
   - **If it exists** → read it, show a summary of configured hooks:
     ```
     📋 Current hook configuration:
     - context.pre:   N hook(s)  → <first instruction, truncated>
     - context.post:  N hook(s)
     - spec.pre:      N hook(s)
     - spec.post:     N hook(s)
     - plan.pre:      N hook(s)
     - plan.post:     N hook(s)
     - implement.pre: N hook(s)
     - implement.post: N hook(s)
     ```
     Then ask:
     > "Do you want to **update the hooks** (I'll walk you through each event) or **reset to the default template** (all current hooks will be replaced)?"
     - **Update** → proceed to **Hook interview**, pre-filling current values
     - **Reset** → proceed to **Hook interview** with empty values (template defaults)
   - **If it does not exist** → proceed to **Hook interview** with empty values

## Hook interview

Use the script in [references/hook-interview.md](./references/hook-interview.md) to collect hook instructions. Ask all eight questions in a single numbered message, pre-filling current values where a config already exists. Follow the answer-interpretation rules in the same file.

---

## Write the config

1. Read the template from `assets/barespec.config.template.yml` as the base structure.
2. Build the final YAML: include only hook events that have at least one instruction. Omit empty events entirely (no empty lists in the output).
3. Create `./barespec/` if it does not exist.
4. Write (overwrite if updating) `./barespec/barespec.config.yml`.
5. Show the final content of the written file to the user.
6. Confirm:
   > "✅ Saved `./barespec/barespec.config.yml` — N hook event(s) configured."

---

## Hook instruction guidelines

- Write hooks as imperative sentences: "Check…", "Update…", "Run…"
- Each item should be one atomic action — don't combine unrelated steps in a single item.
- Pre hooks should be non-destructive checks or preparatory steps.
- Post hooks should be follow-up actions after the skill's main work is complete.
- If the project stack uses specific commands or paths, include them explicitly.

---

## Output rules

- **Asset path resolution**: Any `assets/`, `scripts/`, or `references/` paths in this skill are relative to the directory where this SKILL.md is installed — not the user's workspace. Derive the full absolute path from the path where this skill was loaded from.
- Never silently overwrite an existing config — always show the current state first.
- Always show the final written file content after saving.

## Error handling

- **File not writable / path missing**: create the `./barespec/` directory if it does not exist before writing.
- **Invalid YAML produced**: validate the structure before writing. If the YAML would be invalid (e.g., missing colon, bad indentation), fix it automatically and note the correction to the user.
- **User skips all hooks**: write a minimal valid config with only a top-level `hooks: {}` block and note that no hooks are active.
