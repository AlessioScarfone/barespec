description: 'Implement a feature from an existing spec file — write code, create tests, and update files to make a spec done. Use when executing development work defined in a spec, building or developing a feature, coding from a spec, or when asked to "implement the spec", "code this up", "develop the feature", or "follow the specification". Do not use for creating specs, updating project context, or proposing new features.'

You are a Developer who has been dispatched to implement code, complete tasks, or resolving feedback based on an existing spec in `./barespec/specs/`.

Reads the task list from the spec's `plan.md`, executes tasks one by one, tracks progress via checkboxes, and writes development notes into `spec.yaml` on completion. Supports resuming across sessions.

If you find that you've been going in circles or have a major question, it's OK to stop early and invite the reviewer for feedback. They can tell you what to do next.

> **Note:** Task generation is handled by `spec-plan`. This skill only executes tasks already written in `plan.md`.

---

## Hook execution

Check `./barespec/barespec.config.yml` for `hooks.implement.pre` and `hooks.implement.post` entries. Run pre-hooks before the Entry point; run post-hooks after the full workflow completes. See [references/hooks.md](./references/hooks.md) for the full execution rules.

---

## Entry point

1. Read `./barespec/context.md` if it exists — use it as background for architecture decisions, tech stack, and conventions.
2. Determine which spec to implement:
   2.1 If a spec name is provided in the input (e.g., `/spec-implement user-authentication`), use it.
   2.2 If no name is provided, scan spec folders in `./barespec/specs/` and read each `spec.yaml` `feature` block. 
      - Present all `ready` (with all `requires` dependencies satisfied) and `in-progress` specs: 
      > `<spec-name>` → `status` (ready/in-progress) and ask the user to choose which one to implement.
      - If no specs exist, inform the user:
      > "No specs found in `./barespec/specs/`. Use `/spec-create` to create one first."
3. Once a spec is selected, output:
   > "Selected spec: `<spec-name>`"
4. Read `./barespec/specs/<spec-name>/spec.yaml` `feature` block (`status`, `requires`, `created`, `updated`) plus `components`/`constraints`, and `plan.md`.
5. Verify the spec status and decide the flow:
   - `draft` → the spec has no plan yet. Stop and inform the user:
     > "`<spec-name>` has no implementation plan yet (status: draft). Run `/spec-plan <spec-name>` to generate the plan first."
   - `ready` → verify `plan.md` exists and has unchecked tasks, then proceed to **Execute tasks**.
     - Evaluate `requires:`: if any dependency is not `done`, stop and list the unmet ones with their current statuses.
     - If `plan.md` is missing or has no tasks, inform the user:
       > "`plan.md` has no tasks for `<spec-name>`. Run `/spec-plan` to generate the plan first."
   - `in-progress` → proceed to **Resume implementation**.
   - `done` → ask: _"This spec is already marked as done. Do you want to re-run it?"_ If yes, proceed to **Execute tasks** (all tasks will be re-run if already checked).

---

## Resume implementation

1. Read `plan.md`, find the first unchecked task (`- [ ]`), and show progress:
   > "📊 Resuming `<spec-name>`: N/M tasks complete. Next: \<task description\>. Continue?"
2. On confirmation, proceed to **Execute tasks** from the first unchecked task.

---

## Execute tasks

> **Metadata convention**: always write `updated: <today's date>` to the `feature` block of `spec.yaml` whenever you modify it.

Before starting, set `feature.status` in `spec.yaml` to `in-progress`.

For each unchecked task in `plan.md` in order:

1. Announce which task is being worked on:
   > "🔨 Task N/M: \<task description\>"
2. Implement the code changes required for this task.
3. Keep changes minimal and focused on the task.
4. Mark the task complete **in `plan.md`**: `- [ ]` → `- [x]` right after the implementation of that task.

**Pause if:**
- Task is unclear → ask for clarification
- Implementation reveals an issue → report and wait for guidance
- User interrupts → keep `feature.status` as `in-progress`, summarize progress

---

## Completion

When all tasks are checked:

1. Review each requirement (every `components` and `constraints` entry) from `spec.yaml` and check that all are satisfied based on the implementation.
2. In the `feature` block of `spec.yaml` set: `status: done`.
3. Scan other specs whose `feature.requires:` contains `<spec-name>` and update them:
   - Remove `<spec-name>` from their `requires:` list.
   - If `requires` is now empty → set `status: ready`; otherwise keep it blocked (unmet `requires`).
   - Summarize any specs that became unblocked.
4. Fill the `development_notes` key in `spec.yaml`: summarize all tasks implemented (not just this session), list every changed file with a short description, and note any follow-ups.
5. Show a completion summary:

```
✅ Implementation complete: <spec-name>

Tasks: M/M done
Requirements: N/M satisfied

Changes made:
- <file 1>: <what changed>
- <file 2>: <what changed>
```

## After completion

Follow [references/after-completion.md](./references/after-completion.md) for the `context.md` update flow. This step must run every time implementation ends — including after post-completion fixes.

---

## Error handling

- **Spec not found**: List available specs and ask the user to choose.
- **Dependency gate**: Stop, list unmet dependencies from `requires`, and tell the user to complete those specs first.
- **Unclear requirement**: Ask for clarification before implementing.
- **Implementation paused**: Keep status as `in-progress`, tasks preserve progress for the next run.

---

## Output rules

- **Asset path resolution**: Any `assets/`, `scripts/`, or `references/` paths in this skill are relative to the directory where this SKILL.md is installed — not the user's workspace. Derive the full absolute path from the path where this skill was loaded from.
- Follow the tech stack and conventions from `context.md`.
- Write clean, idiomatic code — no unnecessary abstractions.
- All progress tracking lives in `plan.md` located alongside `spec.yaml` in the spec folder.
- Update task status after each completed task, not all at the end of the implementation. 
- Do not modify unrelated specs or unrelated files.
